Assignment 8
Johnnie Phelps
If you have not already, catch up on some of the video assignments for the course. 
Create a file called Assignment 8.md and, in it, describe which video from the series was the most helpful and 3-4 sentences why.

================================================================
I have found Trev's videos very helpful and user friendly. 
Trev has a distinct voice that reminds of the people who make videos at KhanAcademy. 
They're easy to follow and understand. 
His video on Logic Laws helped me out with a few assignment questions. 
I have ventured into to his other videos to help with other math shenanigins.
