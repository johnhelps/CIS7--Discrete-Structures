Assignment 6
Write a program in C++ that calculates the GCD of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.

Requirements:

 Allow the user to input both numbers
 Validate that the numbers are positive integers
 Display the amount of time it took to calculate the GCD (hint: use the system clock)
 Afterwards, ask the user if they want to re-run the program
